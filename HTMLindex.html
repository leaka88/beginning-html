    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      I have wanted to finish my college education for the last 20 years. I stressed to my children the importance of higher education to further your goals, not just high school. I put off my ambitions long enough and now I want to be an example to my children to never give up your dreams.

    <h2>Pivot Technology Scholorship</h2>
    <p>
        No matter how many times I changed my major in college or thought of a different career path, computer technology is something I always came back to. I never would have imagined that I while scrolling through Facebook, I would stumble across an opportunity that could change my life trajectory in such a positive way. Now that's it's possible to succeed without going back to a traditional classroom, I am going to take full advantage of this to have a career that I can be proud of, not just a job that I tolerate.
